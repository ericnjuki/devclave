<h3>Part 1: Dockerizing the .NET Core API</h3>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  <span class="dropcaps">S</span>o I have an existing ASP.NET Core API that I need hosting for.
  Looking to spend exactly zero dollars on hosting fees, I didn't find any friendly hosting services
  that you could use for ASP.NET apps and SQL Server for absolutely FREE FOREVER. 
  The closest I got was Heroku, which supports Docker. I decided to try it.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  The task is to dockerize my API together with an instance of SQL Server for my database.
  I quickly found out that it's best practice to have only one app/service/thing per container.
  So my API and database would have to live in separate containers and somehow talk to each other.
  Further research led me to Docker Compose which is bred for exactly this purpose.
  So the tasks are:
  <ul>
    <li>Dockerize my API</li>
    <li>Dockerize an instance of SQL Server</li>
    <li>Connect the two using Docker Compose</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
  So here's my current project. It was built on ASP.NET Core 2.2
  Database is made using Entity Framework Core 2.2 code first, targeting SQL Server.
</p>
<img src="" alt="">
<p>
  I'm running Docker on Windows and set to Linux containers.
  The reason I took this approach is to have both the database and API in Linux containers.
  Also, Microsoft doesn't have an official SQL Server Docker image for Windows. Yeah, I know. 
  And since the API uses .NET Core, it's supported on all platforms, including Linux.
  Note: You can use Docker Compose to connect a Linux and Windows container. (https://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/mixing-windows-and-linux-containers-with-docker-compose/)
</p>

<h4>The Dockerfile</h4>
<p>
  The first step to dockerizing an app is to create the Dockerfile.
  A Dockerfile is a file named "Dockerfile" with no file extension.
  It tells Docker how to build your Docker image.
  It does this by specifying the base Docker image you'll need (in this case the asp.net core Docker image 
  provided by Microsoft). It will also allow you to copy all the source files you need from the host into the container
  to ensure the app runs the way it's supposed to. And finally it allows you to issue a command
  to stat your application through the cli. It can do a lot of other things but basically that's it.
  Since this is a multi-project Web API, we're going to place the Dockerfile in the root of the application,
  where the .stn is located. This will allow us to easily navigate to each of the .csproj files in each
  of the projects because we will need those to restore nuget packages in the container.
</p>
<p>
  My Dockerfile looks like this:
</p>

{% highlight Dockerfile %}
bla bla bla
{% endhighlight %}

<h4>Anatomy of the docker file</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h5>Define a base image</h5>
{% highlight Dockerfile %}
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.2 AS build-env
{% endhighlight %}
    <p>here we are...</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Copy project files and restore packages</h5>
{% highlight Dockerfile %}
COPY . ./
RUN dotnet restore "./wekezapp.core/wekezapp.core.csproj"
RUN dotnet restore "./wekezapp.data/wekezapp.data.csproj"
RUN dotnet restore "./wekezapp.business/wekezapp.business.csproj"
{% endhighlight %}
    <p>here we are...</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Publish the project</h5>
{% highlight Dockerfile %}
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o publish
{% endhighlight %}
    <p>here we are...</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Build the runtime image</h5>
{% highlight Dockerfile %}
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:2.2.3
WORKDIR /app/wekezapp.core
COPY --from=build-env /app/wekezapp.core/publish .
{% endhighlight %}
    <p>here we are...</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Start the application</h5>
{% highlight Dockerfile %}
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "wekezapp.core.dll"]
{% endhighlight %}
  </li>
</ol>

And that's it! The full Dockerfile looks like this:

{% highlight Dockerfile %}
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.2 AS build-env
WORKDIR /app

# Copy everything and restore nuget packages
COPY . ./
RUN dotnet restore "./wekezapp.core/wekezapp.core.csproj"
RUN dotnet restore "./wekezapp.data/wekezapp.data.csproj"
RUN dotnet restore "./wekezapp.business/wekezapp.business.csproj"

# Copy publish the project
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o publish

# Build runtime image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:2.2.3
WORKDIR /app/wekezapp.core
COPY --from=build-env /app/wekezapp.core/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "wekezapp.core.dll"]
{% endhighlight %}

<h4>Build the Docker image and create the container</h4>
<p>
  A docker image is like a blueprint that's used to create the actual container.
  You create one using the docker build command.
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
docker build -t wekezapp-image -f Dockerfile .
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Here's the docker build command at work.
  We can see it restoring nuget packages for our projects in the image.
  From here we simply run the image to create the container:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
docker run -it --rm -p 5000:80 --name wekezapp-container wekezapp-image
{% endhighlight %}

<ul>
  <li>
    -it flag tells docker to take you straight into the container.
    So the command line you are on will now be directly connected to the container's shell,
    in this case /bin/bash since it's a Linux container.
  </li>
  <li>
    --rm means to delete the container once the command finishes executing. 
    This isn't bad, as docker containers are generally wanted to be stateless
  </li>
  <li>
    -p 5000:80 tells it to map port 5000 on our local machine to port 80 on the container
  </li>
  <li>
    specify the name of the container and finally..
  </li>
  <li>
    the image used to create the container.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Running this command results in Now listening on: http://[::]:80
  We can access our app by going to localhost:5000.
  And I can now try to access and API endpoint like localhost:5000/api/users
  which is supposed to return a list of users from the db and I get:
  An error occurred using the connection to database 'Wekezapp' on server '.'.
  Great! My app works. This error makes sense because the API is the <i>only</i> thing in the container.
  It's trying to access tje db on the local machine and of course, there is none.
  So in the next part, I will try to containerize my db.
</p>


<h5>General Notes</h5>
- RUN is used to run shell commands in the container
