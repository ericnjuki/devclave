<span class="dropcaps">I</span> do remember quite fondly when we began. When we said we would come here every week and fill pages upon pages with words the world will never see. Not long ago we had a vision: A very beautiful place. A place that would take us back in time. A place where all that is strange and unconventional is suddenly familiar and celebrated. A place we could come and lie down and we would, during these blissful hours, forget all that ails us in the present. Here, we would be monarchs. Here, we would be free.
