_'Twas a busy day at the conclave today…_\\
_Vines were cracking, spells were flying_\\
_and tempers were all but kept at bay_

_"What troubles a caster so?" you ask,_\\
_"With magic at his fingers, and potions in his flask.."_\\
_"Even the best", I respond, "be not immune to mess,_\\
_I had to deal, you see, with angular js"_
