DevClave is a personal project for documenting anything interesting as I try to make sense
of this world of code. It is a log book and a reference point. It is a diary, a stress pillow
and a rubber duck. It is an enchanted hollow beneath a grand oak tree in the middle of wonderland.
DevClave is a place where all that I find beautiful about tech and software and 
this magical world resides, _forever_.
